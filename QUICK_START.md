# Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 For GitHub Upload

Your project is now organized and ready for GitHub! Here's what to do:

### 1️⃣ Initialize Git Repository

Open terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\savy\OneDrive\Desktop\USB\DAA PROJECT MAZE\MazeSolver-master\MazeSolver-master"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Maze Solver with DFS Algorithm"
```

### 2️⃣ Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon → **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `maze-solver-dfs` (or your preferred name)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 3️⃣ Push to GitHub

Copy the commands from GitHub and run them, or use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/maze-solver-dfs.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
